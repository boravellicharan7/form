        <h2>Ulava Charu Vegetable Biriyani</h2>
        <div>
            India is known for its biryani varieties. Today I am going to share a signature recipe of Andhra/Telangana. The highlight of this dish is that we use tamarind instead of yogurt and tomato and also we use curry leaves for this Biryani. Interesting, huh? Read further to learn more about the recipe with step-wise pictures.

Our friends introduced this yummy Ulavacharu recipe to us. It’s a perfect winter recipe as horse gram is known for its heat-producing properties. Every year we get our share of Ulavacharu, but this year I decided to step up and learn the recipe from them and make it myself. I successfully did it. While experimenting the Ulava Charu recipe, I realized that we could make biryani as well and wasn’t that enough to intrigue me?

I know I should have posted the charu recipe first before the biryani. But I posted the biryani picture on my IG, and many asked for the recipe. Hence I decided to post the biryani recipe first and then the charu recipe. I clubbed my friend’s biryani recipe and Vah Chef’s ulavacharu biryani recipe with my variations. And here it is my version of Ulava Charu Biryani Recipe. Please do try and let me know how it turned out.

        <h2>Curry Leaves Are Important</h2>
        <p>
            This biryani has a unique flavor, and the curry leaves elevate and brings out that distinct taste. Please do not skip the curry leaves. :-) The “dum” process infuses the flavors brilliantly and makes this biryani an oh-so-delicious one. But if time is pressing, you can cook rice directly too, but if you get a chance, please opt for the Dum process.

I went with less spice so that vaandu can relish (yes, it’s a kiddo approved recipe as well) but you can modify it as per your preference.  The ingredient list and steps might seem to be lengthy, but as always if you plan well ahead your can prepare this biryani easily.

Here is the detailed step-wise recipe.
